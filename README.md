Beaker is an experimental peer-to-peer Web browser. It adds new APIs for building hostless applications, while remaining compatible with the rest of the Web. [Visit the website.](https://beakerbrowser.com/)

Please feel free to open usability issues. Join us at #beakerbrowser on Freenode.

## Binaries

### [OSX 64-bit .dmg](https://download.beakerbrowser.net/download/latest/osx)

## About

Beaker is a new browser that combines the flexibility of the desktop with the connectivity of the Web.

### Why Beaker?

 - You can share files privately
 - You control your data
 - You can duplicate, modify, and share websites
 - You can use apps while offline
 - You can go back in time and see previous verions of your content

### Features

 - Host sites from the browser
 - Save sites for offline use
 - Share files secretly between devices
 - Versioned URLs for historic lookup
 - New Web APIs
 - Live reloading
 - Native markdown (.md) rendering

With Beaker, we're combining the flexibility of the desktop with the connectivity of the Web.

#### New Web APIs

An example of the [Dat Files API](https://beakerbrowser.com/docs/apis/dat.html):

```js
var archive = await DatArchive.create({
  title: 'My Site',
  description: 'My peer-to-peer website'
})
await archive.writeFile('/hello.txt', 'hello')
await archive.commit()

console.log(archive.url)
// => dat://da2ce4..dc/
```

## Env Vars

- `DEBUG`: which log systems to output? A comma-separated string. Can be `beaker`, `dat`, `bittorrent-dht`, `dns-discovery`, `hypercore-protocol`. Specify `*` for all.
- `beaker_user_data_path`: override the user-data path, therefore changing where data is read/written. Useful for testing. For default value see `userData` in the [electron docs](https://electron.atom.io/docs/api/app/#appgetpathname).
- `beaker_sites_path`: override the default path for saving sites. Useful for testing. Default value is `$HOME/Sites` where `$HOME` is the users home directory.
- `beaker_dat_quota_default_bytes_allowed`: override the default max-quota for bytes allowed to be written by a dat site. Useful for testing. Default value is `'500mb'`. This can be a Number or a String. Check [bytes.parse](https://github.com/visionmedia/bytes.js/tree/a4b9af2bf289175f12b3538eb172f2489844b1ec#bytesparsestringnumber-value-numbernull) for supported units and abbreviations.

## Building from source

Requires node 6.2.1.
In linux (possibly also OSX) you need libtool, m4, automake, make, and g++.

```
sudo apt-get install libtool m4 automake make g++ npm
```

In Fedora:

```
sudo dnf install libtool m4 make gcc-c++ npm
```

To build:

```
git clone https://github.com/beakerbrowser/beaker.git
cd beaker
npm install
npm run rebuild #see https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/5851
npm start
```

If you pull latest from the repo and get weird module errors, do:

```
npm run burnthemall
```

This invokes [the mad king](http://nerdist.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/the-mad-king-game-of-thrones.jpg), who will torch your node_modules, and do the full install/rebuild process for you.
`npm start` should work afterwards.

If you're doing development, `npm run watch` to have assets build automatically.

## Running the tests

Tests use their own package.json:

```
cd tests
npm install
```

To run:

```
cd tests
npm test
```

## Known issues

### tmux

Launching from tmux is known to cause issues with GUI apps in MacOS. On Beaker, it may cause the application to hang during startup.
